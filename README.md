# Pesten

This project was made for an assessment and made use of the deck-of-cards library

[https://deck-of-cards.js.org/](https://deck-of-cards.js.org/)

# Rules

<p>Playes can play a specific card by <b>double click</b> on a card</p>
<p> These cards must have the same symbol ( ♥ ♣ ♦ ♠ ) or the same number (2 t/m ace).</p>
<p>If  a player cant play a card he has to <b>double click</b>  the stock pile</p>
<p>The player which is the first to clear his hands is the winner!</p>
  

# How to deploy

## Development server

  
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
Running ng serve --open also opens the browser automatically

  
## Code scaffolding

  
Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

  
## Build

  
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
